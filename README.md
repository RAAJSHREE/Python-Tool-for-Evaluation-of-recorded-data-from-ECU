# Python-Tool-for-Evaluation-of-recorded-data-from-ECU
Automation solution that combines CAPL scripting for bus signal manipulation with Python-based analysis of ECU-recorded Byte Soup files. The goal is to build an end-to-end automated testing framework that can systematically set bus signals data across multiple cycles and validate the results through intelligent data parsing.
